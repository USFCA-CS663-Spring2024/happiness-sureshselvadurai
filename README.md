## Happiness (Assignment 1)

### Background
    * There is no universally accepted definition of happiness, but there have been some ideas about how it
    could be measured.
    * In this assignment, we investigate the data from the World Happiness Report and produce a report
    about this data

This repository contains two (2) files:
* Dataset from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/data/) > World Happiness Report 2023 > Data for Table 2.1.
* Jupyter notebook is a skeleton for your implementation.

### Data Source
    * World Happiness Data for 2023 : https://worldhappiness.report/data/  : Table 2.1
    * Dataset: DataForTable2.1WHR2023.xls

#### Approach    
    * We first generate the EDA reports and then the requested questions are answered in the end
